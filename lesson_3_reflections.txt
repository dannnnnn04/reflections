When would you want to create a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

When you want to collaborate with as many people to help with your project.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

The reason is because some people who work on the same project commited their own changes to it, which may not favor the changes you made on the project yourself resulting in confusion.
