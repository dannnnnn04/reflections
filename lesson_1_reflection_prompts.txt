How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    

It helped me find the bug more easily


How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    

Easy to track and find explanations of how a file came to be


What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    

It could prevent embarassing changes that is broadcasted


Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    

It saves loading time and grouping of related changes

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    

By typing them in the command line


How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    

It is reassuring that despite the errors 
one could potentially make, one can always go back.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    

Own personal projects in the future

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?

Having an easy access to the entire history of a file makes it easier to collaborate with other people


What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google Docs does?

It would be easier to explain each changes made by keeping track of every modification. The only con would be is that it could be time consuming. 

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

One change could affect all files, that is why on some applications a multiple file change in one commit could make sense.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

git log is used to see the commit history while git diff is to view the difference between two specific commits.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?

Git keeps a version of the file before any changes are made.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

Everytime I start a new project.
